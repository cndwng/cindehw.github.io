            <h1>Fusion Design System</h1>
            <p>August 2020 to June 2022 &#8226; <a href="https://www.factset.com/" target="_blank">FactSet</a></p>
            <p>
                The Fusion Design System is FactSet&rsquo;s new design system, built using atomic design principles. Focused on workflow-driven applications with a sleek visual design, the core tenets of Fusion are that it is responsive, adaptive, and accessible.
            </p>

            <h2>My role</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Designer</b> — I designed and prototyped our components and patterns, collabing closely with designers & engineers alike.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Figma Library Guru</b> — 
                    I led the construction of the majority of the components in our Figma library, creating lightweight, easy-to-use, and flexible Figma components. (Fun fact! I was an intern for FactSet&rsquo;s UX team back in 2018, and my summer project was to build out FactSet&rsquo;s first Figma component library.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Systems Overseer</b> — I consulted with designers on app teams to advise on designs from a systems perspective. We met biweekly to iterate on designs and identify gaps in our design system to address.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Work Examples</h2>
        
            <h3>Date Inputs with Rolling & Relative Dates</h3>
            <p>
                I designed the original date input and calendar components as well as the pattern for adding rolling or relative dates. I also wrote the design guidance on how to use each.
            </p>
            <img class="pic" alt="Examples of how to select dates in the Fusion design system" src="images/portfolio/factset/datepicker2.png">
            <img class="pic" alt="More examples of date selection" src="images/portfolio/factset/datepicker3.png">
            <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;" class="caption">Flows for various methods of date input</div>
            <img class="pic" alt="Guidance written about selecting rolling and relative dates" src="images/portfolio/factset/datepicker.png">
            <div class="caption">Guidance written about using date inputs with comboboxes with rolling and relative dates</div>
        
            <h3>Drag and drop patterns</h3>
            <p>
                I worked on several drag and drop patterns in multiple contexts, ensuring all of them were accessible and developed a pattern now implemented almost everywhere drag and drop is available.
            </p>
            <img class="pic" alt="Examples of drag and drop visuals" src="images/portfolio/factset/dragdrop.jpg">
            <div class="caption">Some drag and drop patterns in Fusion</div>
        
            <h3>Grid states and interactions</h3>
            <p>
                FactSet&rsquo;s products feature lots of complicated grids. I designed a system of states and interactions that is intuitive to view and works seamlessly together.
            </p>
            <img class="pic" alt="Every combination of states in a Fusion grid" src="images/portfolio/factset/gridstates.png">
            <div class="caption">A comprehensive view of the states on a grid cell and how different states interact on the same grid</div>
        
            <h2>Case Study: Grid Actions & Settings</h2>
        
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>FactSet users use multiple applications and have to learn each unique way to interact with a grid. How might we create a seamless experience from app to app for grid users?</p>
        
            <h3>The Team</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 UX Designers</li>
                <li>1 Accessibility expert</li>
                <li>Design systems engineering team</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>We audited our applications, both new and old, to explore the needs of our app teams. We used this information to inform the structure of our shared grid settings experience.</p>
            <p>We also researched other grids, with a focus on web-based applications. Among these were ag-grid, Google Sheets, and, of course, Excel. The common thread in many applications was a context menu triggered from the column header.</p>
        
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <h4>Part 1: Context Menu</h4>
            <p>Performing actions in-context was a common use case across the board. We designed a context menu attached to the column header for this.</p>
            <img class="pic" alt="UI example of a menu opening from a column header" src="images/portfolio/factset/contextmenu.jpg">
            <div class="caption">An example of the column context menu</div>
        
            <h4>Part 2: Grid Display Drawer</h4>
            <p>Other actions and settings would live in a drawer attached to every grid, accessible via the context menu or the settings button on top of every grid.</p>
        
            <img class="pic" alt="Example of a grid with a drawer on top filled with settings" src="images/portfolio/factset/displaydrawer1.png">
            <div class="caption">Where the drawer lives in context of a grid</div>
        
        
            <p>The drawer has three views:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Options: for grid level settings, sorting/grouping, and other grid level actions</li>
                <li>Filters: for managing filters on each column in one place</li>
                <li>Columns: for managing which columns are in view</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="pic" alt="Three views of the drawer used to manage grid settings" src="images/portfolio/factset/displaydrawer2.png">
            <div class="caption">The three views of the drawer: options, filters, columns</div>
        
            <h3>Afterwards</h3>
            <p>A number of spinoff components and patterns were enhanced or created to support this feature, helping us grow our design system further.</p>
            <p>We've also integrated a number of improvements and new features after receiving feedback from users and app teams.</p>
